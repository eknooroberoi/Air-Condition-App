# Air-Condition-App

A simple app with webView and login and signup with Firebase integration

The app sends the coordinates (x,y) entered by the user to a Firebase database for a bokeh server (https://github.com/thesct22/3dplot) to plot on a 3D surface plot.
The app also used WebView to display the 3D plot generated by the bokeh server.
It integrates Firebase for user signup and login.
